# Events, Signals, Grounded Signals, Ideas

*A Framework for Context-Aware, Reactive Startup Storytelling Engineering*

by Paul Otto

---

## **1. Introduction**

Startups operate in relentless motion. Product builds, investor updates, partnerships, and hires happen faster than teams can document them. Each action could become a story that shapes reputation and reach — yet most disappear into Slack threads or release notes.

Traditionally, **reactive PR** waits for such stories to be noticed, by which time the moment has passed. **Proactive PR**, on the other hand, requires constant scanning, framing, and pitching — a full-time editorial discipline few early-stage teams can afford. The result is a chronic paradox: *founders know visibility matters but can’t spare the cognitive bandwidth to create it.*

Poblysh proposes a third path: **reactive teams, proactive systems.**

By embedding context-aware automation beneath normal startup activity, Poblysh transforms operational exhaust into structured Signals, links them to external Events, and evolves them into publishable Ideas. The outcome is the *effect* of proactive PR — timely, coherent, consistent visibility — without draining human focus from product or customer work.

**Thesis:** a system combining **Events**, **Signals**, and **Ideas**, operating through complementary *push* (activity-led) and *pull* (context-led) mechanisms, can engineer storytelling that is both reactive in workflow and proactive in perception.

This paper:

- Defines the Poblysh architecture and its push/pull dynamics.
- Grounds it in existing research on weak-signal detection, context-aware systems, and computational storytelling.
- Demonstrates how such a framework enables startups to communicate proactively by simply reacting to intelligent nudges.
- Outlines evaluation strategies and future challenges.

## **2. Background & Related Work**

### **2.1 Weak Signals and Foresight**

The notion of *weak signals* originates in strategic foresight — those faint, early indicators that precede major shifts. Organizations use them to anticipate opportunity or disruption long before the mainstream notices ([ITONICS](https://www.itonics-innovation.com/blog/how-to-accelerate-weak-signal-detection?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

Automated systems now extract weak signals from news, patents, or social data through clustering and keyword analysis ([ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016328723001064?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

However, these frameworks remain macro-scale, optimized for markets rather than micro-scale startup realities where the *signal source* and the *signal subject* are the same entity. Poblysh adapts weak-signal theory inward: it treats a startup’s own activity as a stream of latent foresight.

---

### **2.2 Context-Aware Systems and Adaptive Behavior**

Context-aware systems in computing modify behavior based on environment: time, location, or user state ([UMD CS](https://www.cs.umd.edu/class/spring2025/cmsc818G/files/contextawaresystemsliteraturereview.pdf?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

Modern AI extends this with *context-aware memory*, preserving relevant facts across interactions to produce continuity and precision ([Tribe AI](https://www.tribe.ai/applied-ai/beyond-the-bubble-how-context-aware-memory-systems-are-changing-the-game-in-2025?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

In social systems, tools like *Collective Narrative* surface share-worthy “moments” by prompting communities contextually ([ACM DL](https://dl.acm.org/doi/fullHtml/10.1145/3462204.3481747?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

Poblysh extends this logic to communications: it senses context across time and discourse, and reacts on behalf of teams, surfacing what’s most narratively potent *when* it matters.

---

### **2.3 Narrative Systems and Computational Creativity**

Humans interpret complexity through narrative — stories organize chaos into meaning ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narrative_paradigm?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

Computational creativity research explores how machines can generate coherent, relevant storylines from structured data ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_creativity?utm_source=chatgpt.com)).

Recent advances in dynamic context tracking and event-triggered story generation ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23512?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) enable systems to produce narratives that evolve as new information arrives.

Poblysh applies these principles to startup communication: *signals become plot points; context becomes timing; the system itself becomes a silent editor.*

---

## **3. Architectural Overview of Poblysh**

### **3.1 From Activity to Awareness**

Poblysh structures storytelling around three building blocks:

1. **Events** – external contexts that shape media and investor attention (global, industry, or country-level).
2. **Signals** – internal traces of activity (commits, launches, hires, partnerships) distilled from connected systems.
3. **Ideas** – editorialized narratives born when internal signals intersect external events.

Each startup operates in two synchronized modes:

- **Push** – detect what you *did* and surface it as a story.
- **Pull** – anticipate what the *world* will care about next and prepare to meet it.

Together they form a reflexive loop: reactive humans responding to proactive software, producing the appearance and results of proactive PR.

### **3.2 High-Level Flow**

*(Diagram suggested: Events ↔ Keywords → Signals → Grounded Signals → Ideas → Feedback)*

Core modules:

- **Events DB** – curated external calendar with tags, industries, and timing windows.
- **Keyword System** – base lexicon + event-expanded terms for scanning.
- **Signal Engine** – ingests, clusters, scores, and binds signals to events.
- **Idea Generator** – converts grounded signals into press-ready story assets.
- **Feedback Loop** – tracks coverage outcomes to recalibrate scoring.

### **3.3 Design Principles**

- **Context-aware by default:** stories align to time, geography, and audience.
- **Human-in-the-loop:** founders approve or enrich, never micromanage.
- **Reactive behavior, proactive outcome:** cognitive relief meets strategic visibility.
- **Learning over time:** every published story refines future detection.

---

### 4. Events & Context Modeling

### 4.1 Taxonomy & Dimensions

Events are organized along these axes:

- **Scope / Reach:** Global, Industry, Country
- **Temporal bucket:** This Month / Next Month / Next Quarter / Others
- **Tags / Themes:** e.g. “AI safety,” “Sustainability,” “Regulation,” “HealthTech”
- **Audience:** media, investors, domain specialists
- **Geography & industry vertical**

This multi-dimensional tagging supports matching between a startup and relevant external context.

### 4.2 Generating Prompts & Keywords from Events

When a startup signals interest in an event, we reverse-engineer *listening prompts*. For instance:

- For a climate summit: “carbon accounting,” “net zero roadmap,” “scope 3 disclosure,” “renewable procurement.”
- For blockchain conference: “layer-2 scaling,” “rollups,” “zk proofs,” “tokenomics.”

These prompts seed the Pull path’s listening mechanism, nudging the system to watch for candidate signals tied to that event.

### 4.3 Temporal Windows & Binding

Each event has a start/end window. Signals detected within a proximate window or planned *announce window* (often before or just after) are more likely to gain traction. Binding a Signal to an event increases its “urgency” score dimension.

---

## 5. Keyword → Signal → Grounded Signal → Idea Pipeline

### 5.1 Layered Progression

At the heart of Poblysh lies a four-stage progression that transforms ambient data into actionable narratives:

1. **Keyword:** The system’s most primitive listening unit. These lexical cues (e.g., *release, partnership, hiring, audit*) act as semantic triggers for scanning connected sources.
2. **Signal:** When clusters of keywords and temporal proximity indicate activity, Poblysh forms a *signal candidate*. This is still unverified — a hypothesis that “something story-worthy” occurred.
3. **Grounded Signal:** Through targeted scanning and iterative self-reflection, the system enriches the raw signal with evidence, timing, and audience context. It attaches internal events to external ones, calculates quality scores, and produces a verified, context-aware artifact.
4. **Idea:** The narrative synthesis layer. Grounded Signals are translated into human-readable, channel-appropriate stories — PR pitches, blog outlines, or investor updates.

This staged approach ensures that Poblysh doesn’t generate random “content suggestions” but surfaces events anchored in measurable reality.

---

### 5.2 Technical Implementation

Each stage corresponds to a structured data object:

| Stage | Main Input | Enrichment Source | Primary Output |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Keyword | Event tags, AI expansions | Event DB, industry lexicons | Keyword repository |
| Signal | Keyword clusters | Slack, GitHub, CRM, PRD | Candidate Signals |
| Grounded Signal | Signals + Evidence | External events, scoring engine | Verified context objects |
| Idea | Grounded Signals | Editorial templates | Multi-channel story assets |

The process is recursive: published Ideas feed back into the keyword-weighting layer, refining future detection precision.

---

### 5.3 Scoring & Thresholds

Each Signal carries telemetry across six weighted axes — *relevance, novelty, timeliness, impact, alignment,* and *credibility.*

A signal matures into a Grounded Signal when its total score surpasses a learnable threshold (e.g., 0.7).

Scores decay over time using exponential half-life functions to prevent stale stories from resurfacing.

---

## 6. Scoring, Ranking & Quality Telemetry

### 6.1 Why Scoring Matters

Storytelling is subjective, but editorial timing isn’t. Poblysh’s scoring framework introduces objectivity into what makes a story publishable.

Rather than trusting arbitrary hunches, it quantifies *why* a moment deserves attention.

### 6.2 The Six Dimensions

1. **Relevance** — proximity to the startup’s ICP, vertical, and customer narrative.
2. **Novelty** — differentiation from previously surfaced Signals or competitor updates.
3. **Timeliness** — recency and alignment with external event windows.
4. **Impact** — tangible value (users affected, growth, performance gains).
5. **Alignment** — fit with editorial calendars or trending themes.
6. **Credibility** — evidence density and source reliability.

Each score is normalized to 0–1, weighted, and aggregated.

For example:

```
Total Score = 0.2R + 0.15N + 0.15T + 0.2I + 0.15A + 0.15C

```

Signals above 0.75 are automatically promoted for idea generation; those between 0.55–0.74 receive improvement nudges.

---

### 6.3 Nudging System

When a Signal underperforms, Poblysh proposes the smallest viable upgrade:

- *“Add a metric (e.g., user count or MRR change).”*
- *“Attach a customer quote for credibility.”*
- *“Specify timeframe to clarify timeliness.”*

This balances automation with founder agency — guiding without overwhelming.

---

### 6.4 Editorial Telemetry

Over time, Poblysh learns which combination of scores predicts publication or engagement success.

A feedback matrix tracks correlation between score profiles and press outcomes, creating startup-specific tuning curves.

---

## 7. Push & Pull Dynamics

### 7.1 The Push Model: Activity-Led Story Discovery

In the **push** mode, Poblysh listens to what startups *do*, not what they *say*.

Data flows from internal systems — product releases, commits, partnership logs, CRM updates, even investor newsletters.

The AI parses this activity into candidate Signals.

**Example Flow**

```
GitHub commits + internal changelog → cluster (keyword: "integration")
→ detect "Beta GPT-5 integration" → attach usage metrics → enrich
→ align to “AI Summit” → propose Idea draft

```

Push stories emerge naturally from lived progress. They minimize PR theatre — startups focus on work, and Poblysh surfaces what matters.

---

### 7.2 The Pull Model: Context-Led Story Anticipation

Pull mode begins outside.

Startups subscribe to external events (from the Events DB). Poblysh then:

1. Generates prompts and keywords tied to those events.
2. Monitors connected channels for emerging related activity.
3. Suggests *traction ideas* the startup could execute to join that conversation.

If founders act on these ideas, new activity arises — feeding back into push detection.

Pull mode aligns storytelling with *timeliness*; push mode ensures *authenticity*.

---

### 7.3 The Flywheel

Over time, both paths feed each other:

```
External event → pull prompts → startup acts → internal signals → push path activates → grounded signal → idea → publication → refined learning → new pull prompts
```

The result is a self-reinforcing loop where the startup’s natural operations continuously generate narrative momentum.

---

### 7.4 Behavioral Analogy

Push corresponds to *output awareness* — recognizing one’s own motion.

Pull corresponds to *contextual awareness* — sensing the larger environment.

Together, they form the reflexes of a context-aware organism that “feels” when to speak.

---

## 8. Implementation Considerations

### 8.1 Data Model Essentials

The minimal relational schema includes:

| Table | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `events` | Stores curated external events (fields: id, name, tags, time window, location) |
| `signals` | Raw and grounded signals with scoring telemetry |
| `signal_evidence` | Source snippets, timestamps, and provenance |
| `ideas` | Generated stories, status, and channels |
| `coverage_outcomes` | Publication metadata and performance |
| `event_signal_link` | Join table connecting external events with internal signals |

Indexes: composite (startup_id + time), vector index for semantic clustering on signal text.

---

### 8.2 Algorithmic Building Blocks

- **Keyword Extraction:** TF-IDF or contextual embeddings (e.g., BERT, OpenAI text-embeddings-3-large).
- **Clustering:** Hierarchical density clustering (HDBSCAN) for temporal proximity.
- **Scoring:** rule-based + machine learning hybrid; weights fine-tuned per vertical.
- **Decay:** exponential decay function per signal type.
- **Idea Generation:** templated natural language generation tuned with startup tone presets.

---

### 8.3 Privacy, Ethics & Safety

- Consent gates for all integrations (Slack, GitHub, CRM).
- NDA and embargo flags that prevent premature publishing.
- Optional anonymization for AI training.
- Audit trails linking every published idea back to verified internal sources.

---

### 8.4 System Performance & Scalability

- **Architecture:** event-driven microservices (Axum backend + Vercel frontend).
- **Processing:** asynchronous workers for scoring and clustering (Redis queue).
- **Storage:** PostgreSQL + pgvector for semantic search.
- **Interface:** minimal UX — surface top 5 Signals, nudge actionable next step.

---

## **9. Evaluation & Metrics**

### **9.1 Research Hypotheses**

Poblysh’s framework aims to demonstrate that **proactive outcomes can emerge from reactive behaviors** when supported by intelligent systems.

We propose the following hypotheses:

1. **H1 — Reactive Precision:** Signals generated passively from startup activity (push mode) will reach equal or higher publication success than manually planned PR campaigns.
2. **H2 — Contextual Timing:** Startups using the push/pull system will publish contextually aligned stories faster than traditional PR workflows, reducing time-to-coverage windows.
3. **H3 — Cognitive Efficiency:** Teams using Poblysh will spend significantly less mental effort on storytelling tasks, yet experience an increase in perceived market visibility.

### **9.2 Experimental Setup**

- **Participants:** 15–25 early-stage startups (AI, fintech, sustainability, SaaS).
- **Duration:** 90-day observation period.
- **Method:** A/B split between a control group (manual storytelling) and a Poblysh group (automated signal-driven workflow).
- **Data Collection:** Telemetry logs, user surveys, and coverage analytics.

### **9.3 Key Metrics**

| Category | Metric | Description | Expected Effect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Speed** | Time-to-story | Time from signal detection → publication | ↓ by 50% |
| **Volume** | Stories surfaced per month | Avg. number of high-score signals | ↑ by 2× |
| **Quality** | Coverage rate | % of signals resulting in press | ↑ vs. control |
| **Cognition** | Time spent on PR tasks | Founder self-reported hours | ↓ by 60% |
| **Retention** | System re-use | Active startups month-over-month | ↑ by 30% |

### **9.4 Ground Truth & Human Evaluation**

All detected signals are manually audited for *storyworthiness* by editorial reviewers using a 1-5 scale (clarity, timeliness, novelty, credibility).

The resulting labels serve as a baseline for model precision, recall, and reinforcement learning updates.

---

## **10. Case Studies & Scenarios**

### **10.1 AI Startup — Reactive System, Proactive Presence**

**Context:** GPT-5 global launch (external event).

**Internal Signal:** Changelog entry — “Beta integration for enterprise users complete.”

**Action:** Poblysh attaches timing window, adds usage metrics, and drafts a story outline.

**Outcome:** Founder accepts nudge, story publishes within 48 hours:

> “How We Cut Support Time 18% by Moving to GPT-5.”
> 

No PR planning meeting was held. The startup appeared proactive; in truth, it simply reacted to a timely prompt.

---

### **10.2 Climate Fintech — Pull-Driven Opportunity Creation**

**External Pull:** COP conference triggers keyword set (“scope 3,” “ESG reporting”).

**Detected Push Signal:** Partnership with a carbon-accounting startup.

**Grounding:** Aligned to COP window, added policy relevance.

**Outcome:** Feature published in Clean Energy Wire; inbound demo requests +25%.

Here, the system’s proactive awareness guided a reactive team toward global conversation.

---

### **10.3 Accelerator Portfolio — Collective Awareness**

Ten startups under one accelerator used Poblysh. Signals from individual teams aggregated into a **“City Momentum Feed.”**

Each company gained secondary visibility through the others’ stories. The accelerator’s brand perception shifted from reactive support to proactive ecosystem leadership.

---

## **11. Challenges, Limitations & Future Work**

### **11.1 Managing Noise in a Reactive Environment**

Reactive data streams contain noise — false positives, redundant updates, incomplete metrics. Poblysh mitigates this through scoring and human-in-the-loop verification but further refinement is needed to filter low-value chatter.

### **11.2 The Cold Start Dilemma**

A newly onboarded startup without connected systems or event selections produces limited signals. Seeded keyword packs and templated prompts can bootstrap early detection until organic signals accumulate.

### **11.3 Editorial Bias & Cultural Context**

Perceived “newsworthiness” varies across regions and industries. The scoring system must learn local editorial norms to avoid over-amplifying Western media standards in African or emerging-market contexts.

### **11.4 Data Privacy & Ethical Guardrails**

Listening integrations (Slack, GitHub, CRM) require strict consent, redaction, and opt-out controls. Poblysh operates under an “awareness, not surveillance” principle — visibility should empower, not expose.

### **11.5 Long-Term System Learning**

Reactive systems risk stagnation if they don’t evolve. Poblysh’s scoring model must adapt through feedback loops — learning from publication outcomes, journalist engagement, and user edits.

### **11.6 The Philosophical Tension**

Proactive PR traditionally signals competence and foresight. Reactive teams fear appearing disorganized. Poblysh challenges this narrative: what if *discipline of attention* could be automated?

The tension now shifts from *“are we proactive enough?”* to *“are our systems attentive enough?”*

---

## **12. Conclusion**

Startups often mistake visibility for virtue. They oscillate between silence and noise, trapped in cycles of reactive scrambling and proactive exhaustion. Poblysh reframes the equation.

By engineering a context-aware framework of **Events**, **Signals**, and **Ideas**, startups gain a *proactive narrative posture* without sacrificing focus. Reactive teams remain lean and fast; proactive systems handle timing, context, and synthesis. Together, they form an **ambient awareness loop** that quietly translates progress into presence.

The result is not just better PR — it’s a shift in how early-stage companies communicate progress, credibility, and intent. Poblysh demonstrates that *when systems think in context, teams can think in peace.*

> Reactive teams. Proactive systems. Continuous narrative.
> 

That is the new foundation for context-aware storytelling in the startup age.
